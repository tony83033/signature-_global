In recent decades, the city has reshaped itself as the country\u2019s center of trade, both domestic and international, with Maruti, Flipkart, AIIMS, Global City, Jungle Safari, and many other developments making this city an iconic place globally.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us remember that superb road infrastructure has played a pivotal role in accelerating economic activities in various industries such as automobile, garment, IT, the service sector, and real estate, leading the business to grow significantly in Gurgaon. Currently, as many as six major roads, highways, or expressways intersect this district, facilitating seamless travel and transportation, which forms the basis of the city&#8217;s economic growth. These roads include NH 48, Sohna Alwar, Delhi Mumbai, KMP, Northern, and Southern Peripheral Roads. Dwarka Expressway is one of the main arterial roads connecting the city to the suburbs and neighboring states.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, there is a pressing need to connect Dwarka Expressway with KMP via Chandu, Badsa, and Patli. Along its alignment, significant establishments such as Badsa AIIMS, Sultanpur Sanctuary, Patli dry-port, a 60-bedded Sheetla Mata hospital, and world-class business establishments are proposed to come up. Therefore, non-stop connectivity is the need of the day so that these top establishments can have direct access to the national capital and the international airport.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>To address this need, the state government has decided to construct a six-lane road that will prove to be a boon to the areas falling in the alignments of Dwarka Expressway and KMP Expressway. This six-lane road will not only provide seamless commuting between Hero Honda Chowk (NH-48) and KMP near Badsa but also reactivate real estate constructions in both housing and commercial terms. The road will bridge the gap between AIIMS healthcare and accessibility, allowing people from Delhi NCR and other states to easily reach the hospital and avail its specialties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>This 8-9 KM long six-lane road will offer government opportunities to carve out new sectors through the development of new master plans, while real estate promoters can build new housing projects and commercial spaces. The news of this six-lane road has spread rapidly. The lands between KMP and Dwarka Expressway, primarily agricultural, are ready to accept and adopt changing urban development for a better tomorrow and quality living for future generations. A significant number of job opportunities are expected to open up in a very short span of time. This is a well-thought-out plan by the state government.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Road and rail infrastructure drive the economy, and Gurgaon is blessed to have superb road infrastructure built by the state government and the Union, leading Gurgaon to become the economic capital of Haryana.
