People from every corner of the country have found employment opportunities in the city, and many of them have decided to stay here permanently. The reason behind their permanent stay is the high living standards, including job security for future generations, and good schools. A recent trend observed in the real estate sector is that mid-segment families, mainly the service class, prefer independent floors in Gurgaon. This trend is evident from the number of independent floor units sold in the last ten years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>An independent floor is a low-rise building of three or four stories with standard-sized units, spacious bedrooms and drawing halls, balconies, and study rooms, among other amenities. The big comfort attached to an independent floor is the safety feeling, unlike the discomfort feeling associated with high-rise buildings of twenty or more stories in which the lift is the only hope.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurgaon&#8217;s real estate journey is hardly forty years old. This city is famous for high-end societies, such as duplex penthouse clubhouses, gyms, swimming pools, etc., developed by big promoters, resulting in land appreciation and widening the gap between the rich and poor. To bring parity in the real estate sector, the government has thought of mid-segment or lower medium service class families, and an independent floor is the result of such thinking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>Real estate experts believe that this is the best time to buy an independent floor in Gurgaon, which is available in new sectors across the city. Independent builder floors have been preferred by homebuyers and professionals because of the safety and privacy they offer, unlike multi-story apartments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurugram is a fast-growing urban city in the National Capital Region (NCR). In recent years, new Gurugram sectors have emerged as prime hotspots, and independent floors are a good investment option for homebuyers as they offer higher returns compared to investment in high-rise apartments. There are many reasons behind the exponential growth of the real estate sector in Gurugram, making this city economically prosperous and now a business hub. Owning a floor in Gurgaon ensures a quality life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>For a prospective homebuyer, an independent floor is suggested for two strong reasons: first, the builder provides all the luxuries at a homebuyer&#8217;s pocket budget compared to a high-rise apartment, and secondly, privacy is very much intact with a non-chaotic atmosphere and openness. In the real estate sector in Gurgaon in recent decades, Signature Global has emerged as a reliable real estate promoter due to its buyer-friendly approach. It has received many awards, and its projects follow green building norms and parameters set by the departments. All of its wonderful projects are located in the new Gurugram sectors, which are well connected to the road\/rail networks and available at a pocket-friendly budget.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the last twenty years, Gurugram has emerged as a real estate hotspot in India.
