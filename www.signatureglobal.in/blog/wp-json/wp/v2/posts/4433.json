Earlier, these feeders were maintained by the developer or the respective RWA. But now, these feeders will be operated and maintained by the discom as RWAs do not have the necessary expertise to run and maintain them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are 86 residential societies in the two circles of DHBVN in Gurgaon. In Circle 2, out of a total of 67 group housing societies, 62 have been taken over by the DHBVN, while in Circle 1, only one society out of a total of 19 societies has been acquired by DHBVN. Of these, 26 are in the DLF subdivision, 4 in South City, 2 in Sushant Lok, 3 in Sector 23, 1 in Sector 31, 11 in sector 56 and 14 in the Sohna Road subdivision. The remaining feeders in different residential colonies in the city will be taken over by DHBVN later once the power infrastructure&nbsp;in these&nbsp;residential societies gets completed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The operation and maintenance of independent feeders will ensure regular&nbsp;inspection and faster repairs of electricity faults, ensuring a smooth power supply without prolonged outages. This will help improve the living quotient of the residents, in turn boosting real estate growth in Gurgaon.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) has taken a significant initiative to take over more than five dozen independent feeders in Gurgaon that will help ease the power situation in the city, in turn, give a boost to real estate growth.&nbsp; DHBVN has taken control of 62 independent feeders of 11 kv and 33kv that&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":4434,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4433"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4433"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4433\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":4933,"href":"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4433\/revisions\/4933"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/4434"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4433"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4433"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4433"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
