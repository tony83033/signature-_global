This scenario has had a positive impact on the country&#8217;s economy. Delhi NCR, Bangalore, Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai, and others are good examples of rising urban cities in terms of economic activities and real estate as well. The point in question is that the real estate sector, among all the other high-potential economic activities, has emerged as the most sumptuous business activity. Its rapid growth in a short span of time and its prominence have involved multiple challenges as well. The government felt the need to address these challenges and streamline the real estate sector from time to time, as this sector directly impacts the country&#8217;s common man.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>Long before the conception of the Real Estate (Regulations and Development) Act, the Reserve Bank of India began taking note of housing prices in urban areas that involved huge loans and interest rates for homes. The Housing Price Index is the result of the RBI&#8217;s routine exercise since then to scale the growth and its rising price graph.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>The Housing Price Index is a quarterly report by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) based on the all-India price movement, using data collected from a few top urban cities. The indices are based on official data of property price transactions obtained from the respective state governments&#8217; registration authorities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon closer observation of the year-on-year housing price trends, it is apparent that the rising housing demand in urban cities has influenced housing prices. Let&#8217;s take a look at the recent quarters&#8217; growth to better understand the subject and decide if it&#8217;s the right time to invest in property. We observe that the all-India House Price Index rose by 5.1 percent in the April-June quarter of 2023-24, compared to 3.4 percent a year ago, according to data released by the Reserve Bank of India. The RBI releases its quarterly data based on transaction-level data it receives from the respective registration authorities of major cities in the country, with the highest growth seen in Delhi NCR.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>One crucial note here is that home prices are evidently rising in urban cities in our country despite the hike in interest rates by the Reserve Bank of India to combat inflation. This indicates that the continuing price rise, influenced by high interest rates on home loans across the metro cities, is not a deterrent. This suggests that the country&#8217;s economy is growing, and people are cautious about their life, education, and living conditions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurugram is one such top city among others that has witnessed remarkable population growth, along with a surge in housing demand. Gurugram&#8217;s population has grown on average by two lakhs per year in recent decades alone. This rapid population growth has influenced housing demand, leading to rising home loans and interest rates, which, in turn, have energized economic activities. This is the reason Gurugram is now among the few top cities in the world in terms of real estate and economic activities, including businesses and industries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>For a prospective property buyer, such data is eye-opening. Investing in Gurugram&#8217;s real estate properties assures high returns in both residential and commercial sectors. One should take a little care to verify the credentials of real estate promoters and their projects. Your investment is secure in the right project with the right developer.
