Multiple sector roads link these sectors with far-reaching roads of NH-48 and Pataudi Road, KMP, NPR etc. The 29-KM long Dwarka Expressway (NPR) from Kherki Daula to Mahipalpur (Delhi) which is hardly 3\/4 KM from these areas is now efficiently being used as an alternative route to Delhi and it is much more convenient. Similarly, the extensive NH-48 is the significant route that is 5 minutes drive from here, the nearest railway stations such as Basai Dhankot and Gurgaon are hardly 10 minutes drive and Indira Gandhi International Airport is merely 30 minutes drive only.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>The commuting between Delhi and Gurgaon has always been a challenge for commuters due to the heavy traffic congestion on all the existing roads including the NH 48. But now the situation is expected to improve drastically soon with the completion of the much-awaited Dwarka Expressway. Earlier, it was known as northern peripheral road (NPR) and its length was only 18 KM from Kherki Daula to Delhi border at Sector 111, New Palam Vihar in Gurugram and the Haryana Shahri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) was its custodian authority. The rapid urban development sign with full potential in Gurugram and in the NCR overall, the NHAI took over the NPR and stretched its alignment 10 KM more from the border to Mahipalpur to connect and improve the traffic situation and bring airport much closer to millennium city and planned for 23 KM elevated road out of 29 KM length so that traffic of surface and flyover can run separately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hopes of property seekers are going to be fulfilled as the 29-kilometer-long NPR is likely to see the light of the day anytime in June or later and expected to reduce the travel time between Delhi and Gurgaon significantly and make daily commuting much easier. This good news has come a long way, however. The constructions for the NPR had begun in 2011 but it got stuck in various land litigation that led to inordinate delay in construction and finally the NHAI took over the NPR in 2016\/17 and revamped a mega budget project for both surface and elevated &#8211; surface traffic between the two cities and smooth ride through elevated one for long distance traffic. The completion of the expressway is expected to bring a big relief to daily commuters, businesses, and to residents in the region.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>These sectors are to get maximum property appreciation as the Dwarka Expressway is expected to accelerate economic activities in the region because improved connectivity between Delhi and Gurgaon will attract businesses, investments in land affordable housing, floors, flats and plots \u2013 in residential and commercial sectors both. It is quite possible people living in densely populated colonies of west Delhi may look forward to a better environment and quality living in areas along Dwarka expressway having their businesses schools etc still in Delhi would not be a hindrance. The reduced travel time will also enable employees to commute to their workplaces quickly, thereby increasing their productivity. This expressway is blessed to have this widest road infra project 210 metre wide with 90 metre motorable portion and then 30 metre lush green belt each side and then space for service road \u2013 not seen in any part of the country such widest road built planned for local traffic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>The purpose of the Haryana government was to build along it a beautiful Gurugram and it granted licences to promoters to build better roads and beautiful sectors and societies and bring it close to international airport and national capital. The dream is now almost on the verge of completion \u2013 a big thing for the city.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the past few years only and with the Centre oriented mega road and rail projects enhancements in the national capital region (NCR), millennium city at its core of focus, Gurugram\u2019s sectors such as 79, 92 and 93 have been experiencing unbelievable prominence for the property seekers as lot of fresh openings in terms of&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":4718,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4717"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4717"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4717\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":4719,"href":"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4717\/revisions\/4719"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/4718"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4717"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4717"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4717"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
