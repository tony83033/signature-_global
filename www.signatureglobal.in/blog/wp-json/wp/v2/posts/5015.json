In fact, this city has outpaced others in various aspects, be it the industry, IT sectors, MNCs, or the real estate market. Gurugram has made remarkable progress in the past few decades, evident from its exponential population growth and physical expansion of the city&#8217;s infrastructure. The progress has been noteworthy and the city still holds immense potential. The state government established the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) as an umbrella body. Two decades ago, Gurugram was confined to its old municipal limits, but now it has expanded up to Kundli, Manesar, and Palwal, effectively coming under the control of the GMDA. This expansion is not a minor achievement. The recent progress in the southern region of Gurugram is exceptional, similar to how Gurugram itself emerged as a southern offshoot of Delhi decades ago. Sohna and areas near Manesar, Pataudi, and Jhajjar have witnessed remarkable growth in the real estate sector, particularly catering to the mid-income segment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>With the implementation of road and rail projects focused on the national capital region (NCR), especially in the southern part of Gurugram, areas like Sohna and sectors 37, 79, 81, 92, and 93 have experienced significant advancements in real estate. These areas have seen the emergence of budget-friendly housing projects that offer independent floors, affordable housing options, and residential plots. Sectors 92 and 93, in particular, provide a range of residential properties at more affordable rates compared to neighboring areas in new Gurugram, making it an attractive investment opportunity for the mid-income segment due to its safety and security.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>The road infrastructure has greatly improved, with multiple sector roads connecting these areas to NH-48, Pataudi Road, KMP, NPR, and other major routes. The 29-kilometer long Dwarka Expressway (also known as the NPR) from Kherki Daula to Mahipalpur in Delhi is considered the lifeline for these sectors, providing the best route for commuting to and from Delhi, with the international airport just a 15-minute drive away. These sectors are easily accessible from NH-48, the Delhi to Jaipur highway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>It has been observed that these sectors have witnessed significant appreciation in real estate value, thanks to their excellent road networks, such as the Dwarka Expressway, and the proposed metro line alongside it. Three metro lines are currently in the pipeline, with two under proposal and one under construction, aimed at covering these sectors and improving last-mile connectivity to an unimaginable extent. The presence of metro and road networks has stimulated various activities, attracting businesses, investments in affordable housing, floors, flats, and plots, both in the residential and commercial sectors. It is quite possible that people residing in densely populated colonies of Delhi and its suburbs may consider settling in Gurugram for a better environment, education, and quality living in areas along the Dwarka Expressway. Additionally, reduced travel time to and from Delhi will enable employees to commute to their workplaces quickly, thereby increasing productivity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>The Haryana government&#8217;s objective was to develop a beautiful Gurugram and granted licenses to promoters for constructing budget-friendly houses for the mid-income segment. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/global-park.php\">Signature Global<\/a>, the most reliable real estate promoter in the city, has offered a wide range of housing projects and commercial units at affordable prices to homebuyers.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Like any other city, Gurugram has witnessed significant development.
