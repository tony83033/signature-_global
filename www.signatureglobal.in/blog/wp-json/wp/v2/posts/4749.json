There are three strong reasons the sale purchase of properties will see exponential growth in new Gurgaon in coming years. Delhi Jaipur highway (or Nh 48) is to be connected with Dwarka expressway to expedite development in the new sectors in terms of civic amenities and traffic. One rail over bridge (ROB) that has been opened near Basai Dhankot railway station on Delhi Rewari railway line now will, for sure, have a far reaching impact on property boom. Multiple housing projects have been launched in new sectors along the Dwarka expressway. Now, commuting will be easy between new sectors and NH 48 and other parts of the city and it will reduce traffic bottlenecks on Basai flyover, a big concern for residents. So, intra-city commuting is no more tiresome. Secondly, another utility is to see the light of day and that is the upcoming cloverleaf on NH 48 near Kherki Daula toll plaza. This cloverleaf will prove a boon for the city and it was desired for years. It will connect NPR, SPR and NH 48 together to complete the traffic rotary of the city. And the third one which is also a rail under bridge (RUB) to see the light of the day anytime by June\/July. The RUB is being constructed near Sector 104 and it will help intra-city commuting too easily. Road and rail network is the lifeline of Gurugram.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Nextfive1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4750\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>With increasing population, the housing demand is also observed on the higher side as well, in particular, demand for\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/residential\/premium\/\"><strong>individual premium floors<\/strong><\/a>.
