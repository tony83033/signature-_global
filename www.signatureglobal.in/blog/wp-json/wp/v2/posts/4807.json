The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) built its yellow line in Delhi extending it to Gurgaon linking millennium city with Delhi at Connaught Place in the year 2008\/09. Much later only, a rapid metro line was built along the certain road only and that too left to NH 48 only. Almost 70 percent areas of Gurgaon remain deprived of metro facility since then and in the meantime three general and assembly elections held, it did not deter real estate growth, however. Yes, last mile connectivity will improve far and wide with a new metro line proposed to connect areas right to the NH 48 now and its maximum advantage will be availed by new sectors along the Dwarka expressway.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The news of introduction of the &#8216;Gurugram Metro&#8217; during the Haryana Budget brought three cheers to the residents of the city since it is believed to also boost real estate as demand for homes and commercial space is expected to increase. The proposed metro line of 29-km would connect Huda City Centre to Cyber City via Dwarka expressway and Old Gurgaon and it is likely to have as many as 27 metro stations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the age of technology, the metro has proved the lifeline of a modern city across the globe without which the expected development target cannot be achieved. For the Haryana government, Gurgaon is its economic capital since it gets seventy percent of state revenue alone from Gurgaon only which is a big thing. And Gurgaon is considered an offshoot of the national capital. Its closeness or its proximity with international airports is a big advantage. Now, the sectors on the Dwarka expressway will see an unexpected rise in real estate since it will also help increase economic activities in the area which is a good sign. And this is a fantastic opportunity for investors and property buyers to avail the opportunity before metro sees the light of the day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the last few decades, Gurgaon has seen considerable growth in the housing sector, including both luxury and inexpensive complexes as well as in terms of commercial establishments. The presence of convenient mobility near residential and corporate complexes drives sales for real estate developers and attracts potential buyers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a fact that Gurugram&#8217;s success has been hampered by high traffic, which has discouraged daily commuters and prospective buyers from investing in and relocating to the city. The proposed metro route will reinstate people&#8217;s faith and progress on the fast track.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurugram metro extension, if completed, would provide commuters in Gurugram and Dwarka with an efficient and environmentally friendly transportation system. The proposed metro would undoubtedly make commuting more convenient to and fro from the national capital.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Metro is, indeed, long awaited in Gurgaon, as it is the need of the day, especially for the areas right to the NH 48 \u2013 if heading from Delhi to Jaipur; left to NH 48 is already the metro infrastructure available for years and its advantages well availed by the areas in terms of property&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":4808,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4807"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4807"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4807\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":4934,"href":"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4807\/revisions\/4934"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/4808"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4807"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4807"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4807"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
