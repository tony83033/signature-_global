Gurgaon is a real estate hotspot and it has come a long way to claim status of millennium city and thanks to the government that contributed a lot to its present state along with real estate promoters and property buyers who despite frequent circle rate increase showed interest in buying properties in this city for better life &#8211; including best job profile, health and school education etc. These all factors are intertwined with circle rate, indeed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few weeks ago, the Haryana government increased city&#8217;s circle rates up to 30 percent and the rates have been increased largely in the sectors located along the southern and northern peripheral road (SPR &amp; NPR). The increase in circle rate will simply enhance an increase in paying more stamp duty to the government at time of registry of properties that in turn implies that the government is satisfied with the internal survey of properties and land rated high due to higher frequency of sale and purchase in the area. The increase in circle rate also certifies the level of infrastructure has been provided in the area by the government. The circle rate, which is also referred to as the collector&#8217;s rate, is the minimum price at which a property is registered with the state&#8217;s revenue department and no one can sell properties below the circle rate set by the government. Gurgaon&#8217;s increasing living standard is par excellence.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real estate experts and agencies, too, believe that the increase in circle rates in Gurgaon has been in line with the increase in property prices because of the substantial growth in property demand and supply due to tremendous infrastructure developments and superb enhanced connectivity in the city.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a little doubt that the increase will have an immediate impact on property prices, as they are anyway sold at higher market rates, already, rather it indicates the flourishing real estate industry in Gurugram and its surroundings. It will boost further demand and supply scene over the next few years and before rail or metro networks and proposed and under construction roads, highways, expressways etc see the lights of the day and circle rates go high, accordingly. With the completion of significant infrastructure projects, especially the road connectivity, the experts anticipate a further surge in demand for both housing and commercial real estate that will further lead to a scope of rise in prices. To a little extent, the homebuyers may feel a pinch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The land appreciation in Gurgaon has gone up many times in the last forty years and so its population and prosperity grew in leaps and bounds. That is the reason every real estate promoter wishes to build real estate projects in Gurgaon and every top industry, top corporate&nbsp;establishments etc for all Gurgaon is a hotspot and so the people from across the country and abroad want to settle or do business here. In the given scenario, the increase in circle rate would encourage real estate growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As on date, Gurgaon is focus and centre of attraction in the planning board of the national capital region and accordingly infra projects are being devised and executed \u2013 whether it is rail or metro corridor or Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor, KMP, Gurgaon Alwar etc all giving big boom to the real estate growth only.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anytime over the next one year or two the RRTS would see the light of the day since constructions are going in full swing and it will transform the entire commuting system as the DMRC did years ago. India&#8217;s mega first and foremost construction project such as Global City is going to be reality of the day in this city only \u2013 a matter of great prestige and pride. Similarly, Asia&#8217;s largest leopard safari or Jungle Safari is going to be built in Gurgaon&#8217;s Aravalli foothills only anytime over the next couple of years.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These all are terrible parts of development of Gurgaon estimated to bring a lot of pride for its citizens. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The circle rate is a certificate of a city that marks its living standard and its property evaluation and lifts its image on the global platform; gradually that Gurgaon is inching towards.
