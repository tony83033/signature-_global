With a steady rise of 2.5 per cent year-on-year investments, this premier residential market has jumped to USD&nbsp; 754 million in valuation during the January-September period. This jump is huge when compared to USD 345 million during the same period last year. This substantial&nbsp;increase in investments holds a lot of promise for residential real estate growth in the coming year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Total investments&nbsp;in Indian&nbsp;real estate have risen by 18% to reach USD 3.6 billion in valuation during the first nine months of this year, compared to 3.03 billion in the corresponding period of the previous year. These inflows were largely driven by the office segment that accounted for 50% share, though housing also contributed significantly. Domestic investors have become more active in the market, with their investment inflows accounting for 18% share during January-September 2022&nbsp;period, compared to 14% share during the same period last year. The trend of global investors partnering with domestic developers through joint development platforms is very encouraging.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, the capital in Indian real estate is getting more broad-based with the active participation of retail and institutional investors. As such, the sentiment of global investment firms to invest in Indian real estate remains strong. Especially so, as a 7% predicted growth rate of the economy in FY23 and over 6% in FY24 would support the real estate sector and all this bode well for the growth prospects of the sector in 2023.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Notwithstanding the global recession, institutional investments in Delhi-NCR&#8217;s real estate have made significant increases.
