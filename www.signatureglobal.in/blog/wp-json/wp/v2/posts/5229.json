The state government has now allowed the registration of independent floors on commercial plots in licensed colonies. This move is welcomed, as it conveys a noble and pro-entrepreneur message aimed at stimulating economic activities. It is apt and responds to the growing demand in the market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>In real estate terms, this decision will significantly foster the growth of the commercial real estate segment. It will create demand, leading to an increase in the prices of residential plots, as the decision allows people to open offices or commercial spaces on these floors, thereby driving up rental values. The government believes that this move will empower professionals to own offices and start their businesses stress-free from these independent floors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, buyers or investors can purchase parts of buildings for self-use or leasing and get the properties registered, allowing for complete freedom from leasing or renting, resembling a form of temporary settlement. Investors and promoters alike have praised this decision, as it represents a forward-looking approach that will stimulate investment and business growth in the state.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>The state government has carefully considered this decision, believing it will unlock opportunities for businesses, investors, and entrepreneurs, attracting both local and global enterprises and establishing the state as an investment hotspot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurugram will benefit significantly from this decision, being a hub of commerce and innovation. Licensed colonies have always been the preferred choice for businesses due to their well-planned infrastructure, connectivity, and proximity to major markets, making them ideal locations for commercial ventures. However, the scarcity of suitable commercial spaces in licensed colonies has been a persistent issue, making it challenging for entrepreneurs to secure the right kind of space at an affordable price. As more independent floors are transformed into commercial units, licensed colonies have undergone a remarkable transformation. Cafes, co-working spaces, boutiques, and small offices have flourished in what were once purely residential areas. The sense of community and economic activity in these colonies has grown stronger, attracting even more businesses. Let us not forget that Gurgaon, which is primarily a licensed city, has transformed into a vibrant business hub in recent years.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Haryana government has made a commendable decision in favor of residents who wish to start their businesses independently by purchasing individual floors.
