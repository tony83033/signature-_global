Basic infrastructure such as roads, highways, rail, and metro are the lifelines of development. Gurugram, as we know it today, is an area enclosed by the northern and southern peripheral roads from sectors 1 to 57, forming a semi-circular path of approximately 32 KM. Sectors outside the NPR\/SPR periphery, from sectors 58 to 115, remain largely underdeveloped in comparison to sectors within the periphery. The lack of connecting roads makes daily commuting challenging for people traveling to and from the national capital and within the city itself. The northern peripheral road, popularly known as Dwarka expressway, gained prominence over the southern peripheral road due to its proximity to the international airport and Delhi. However, sectors along the 18-KM Dwarka expressway have remained largely underdeveloped due to delays in its construction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2016, the Haryana government handed over this 18-KM stretch to the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), extending it to Shiv Murti (Mahipalpur) from the Gurugram border, resulting in a total length of 29 KM. However, the reality is that sectors along the expressway are poorly connected with roads, and people still struggle to travel to and from these sectors to Delhi and old Gurugram, as many proposed interconnecting roads are either still on paper or incomplete. Additionally, there is no metro yet. Nevertheless, the Haryana government and the NHAI have recently expedited the construction of all connecting roads and the completion of the Dwarka expressway. In a short while, traveling will become easier for residents living in these sectors, as the remaining sector roads are being built to connect sectors with the expressway. Furthermore, roads, underpasses, and flyovers are being completed to connect the expressway with NH 48.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the roads that were built years ago by the Haryana Shahri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) have become unmotorable. However, with the upcoming opening of the Dwarka expressway by the NHAI, these sector roads will surely be made motorable, making commuting easy and hassle-free for residents. This is good news, as the local custodian authority, Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), has expedited the repair of broken roads and the construction or renovation of others. Funds have been allocated, instructions have been issued, and visible progress can be seen at various locations. The NHAI is expected to open the Dwarka expressway within the next few months, which will pave the way for further development in Gurugram, just as NH 48 did fifteen years ago.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>For prospective property buyers, this is the best time to invest in flats, plots, and independent floors, as land appreciation has significantly increased and is expected to continue rising, especially with the upcoming metro.
