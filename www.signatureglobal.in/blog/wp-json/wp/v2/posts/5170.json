Based on this infrastructure, a city has marked progress as a testimony to world history. Gurgaon, undoubtedly, is rich in terms of road infrastructure with highways and expressways, unlike rail infrastructure, which is largely missing. Long ago, the DMRC built a metro followed by a privately run rapid metro but it remained restricted to limited areas while the Delhi Gurgaon Rewari rail section of the Indian Railway has, so far, contributed less to the development of urban Gurgaon, unfortunately. While the fact is that the rail is always considered a better mode of transport compared to the roadways. Delhi Rewari rail line divides urban Gurgaon in two parts exactly the way NH 48 divided old Gurgaon in two parts. As on date, many developing sectors fall all along the Delhi Rewari railway line but it is less used by urban residents which is why the government for long had been planning for revamping railway stations to make it easily accessible for urban residents by redesigning the stations and connectivity with neighboring areas to make it integral part of communication to and fro from Delhi and vice versa.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the day has come, the Railway Ministry making its plan public to redesign and revamp the two railway stations falling in the district such as Pataudi and Gurgaon. The plan includes revamping of Rewari railway station, also. Revamping Gurgaon and Pataudi railway stations can be a strategic move to boost economic activities in the district and in the surrounding areas. Upgrading these transportation hubs is certain to lead to numerous benefits, including an increased connectivity and enhanced accessibility as well as improved infrastructure benefits to locals, indeed. The steps involve upgrading the railway stations&#8217; infrastructure to meet the modern standards that would mean renovating the existing facilities, expanding the platforms, and providing better amenities to passengers and to improve businesses activities. Upgraded railway stations will certainly draw global attention and attract more trains to run to meet daily needs between Delhi Gurgaon and Rewari and further for commuting and business purposes. And this will boost tourism, business travel, and trade, making the district more accessible for the people from other regions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00a0In terms of economic activities, the revamping process itself will create job opportunities in construction and other related sectors and in addition to it the improved infrastructure will attract more business opportunities in the area leading to further job creations. There is no doubt the improved rail connectivity will attract industrialists and businessmen to set up units in the district. Better rail connectivity often results in increased demand for real estate. This could lead to a surge in property development projects, benefiting the construction industry and the local economy and it would make the district more attractive for domestic and foreign investors. The improved infrastructure and potential for economic growth definitely would encourage investment in various sectors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many real estate projects such as Deen Dayal Jan Awas Yojna, low-rise floors and premium flats are proposed and located by real estate promoters and they will certainly get a boost and attract attention of property investors. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/sg-city-79b.php\"><u><strong><u>Signature Global<\/u><\/strong><\/u><\/a>, city based trustworthy real estate promoter, has plot-projects under DDJAY along the railway line.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The rail and the road infrastructure is the lifeline of a city and an urban area.
