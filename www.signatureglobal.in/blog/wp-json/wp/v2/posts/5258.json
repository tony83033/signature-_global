The underlying concept behind designing this semi-circular road or expressway is to facilitate hassle-free commuting between Delhi and Gurugram, contributing to better urban planning through the seamless alignment of road, rail, and metro designs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the intersection at Badshahpur, where SPR intersects with the Sohna Alwar road, has become a significant bottleneck over the past decade. Despite the presence of a flyover at this intersection, surface crossover remains a major hurdle in local traffic, turning commuting into a nightmare, with traffic management worsening day by day. Recognizing this issue, an underpass has been proposed in the detailed project report prepared by the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) as part of the re-strengthening of the 13-KM SPR\u2014from Ghata Chowk to NH 48 near Kherki Daula.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>This intersection has evolved into a crucial traffic point, connecting not only various internal sectors but also serving as a main connecting point for cities like Faridabad, Gurugram, Manesar, and Sohna. The traffic volume at this intersection has multiplied over the past decade, primarily due to the exponential growth in the real estate sector in Gurugram and Sohna. The NCR residents&#8217; preference for Gurugram, particularly the New Gurugram sectors, has led to a surge in property appreciation, both in terms of land and apartments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>Sohna Road and SPR have transformed into commercial corridors, with malls, multiplexes, retail shops, and SCOs sprouting up due to the increasing demand in the property sector. Real estate promoters are leaving no stone unturned to explore all options and capitalize on the growing urban scenario. The government has launched various financial schemes to assist low and mid-segment families, and new housing policies have been formulated. The NCR planning board and NHAI have committed to delivering road and rail infrastructure. During a recent visit, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal announced a metro line from Badshahpur Vatika Chowk to Pataudi, providing a significant boost to real estate appreciation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>Sohna, a suburb city of Gurugram, stands out as a galloping real estate hotspot, with the town planning department of Haryana actively supporting urban growth. The Sohna road, from Rajiv Chowk to Sohna, is rapidly emerging as an urban corridor. For prospective property buyers, it is advisable to trust a reliable promoter for a risk-free investment. The process involves a small exercise of navigating through the RERA website, as well as the website of TCP, Haryana, and then reviewing the projects of the promoter, delivered or under construction. Signature Global stands out as the most trustworthy real estate promoter, with its projects in Sohna and Gurgaon being non-compromising in terms of quality and adherence to green building norms.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The southern and northern peripheral roads serve as the lifeline of Gurugram, or what we might even call the new Gurugram\u2014from sectors 58 to sectors 115, largely developed by the Haryana government in accordance with the latest Master Plan Gurugram Manesar Urban Complex 2031.
