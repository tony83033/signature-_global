Now, that the city such as Gurugram has become a real the estate hotspot and also it is a business capital of the state attracting attention of the government forcing it to provide best infrastructure to meet the increasing population demand and development requirement investing in land, plot, flat, SCOs etc all it is a smart choice, indeed. Broadly, the city can be divided in two parts to pick the best location for investment in properties accordingly. The city has been developed in phases with some of its pockets emerging as high potential areas. The sectors such as from 58 to 115 came at later stages after successfully meeting the objective of the state government in the first phase of developing sectors up to 57 almost circled by the southern and northern peripheral road (SPR &amp; NPR). At later stages, the government decided to develop a new set of sectors 58 to 115 outside the circle in an orbit corridor manner \u2013 sectors 58 to 80 along the SPR and sectors 81 to 115 on the NPR. The sectors connected with Sohna Alwar road, NH 48, Dwarka expressway are considered comparatively high potential zones. The projects launched in sectors such as Sector 79, 92, 93, 37 C &amp; D and sectors on Dwarka expressway marked excellent scopes of development in the recent past.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As on date, investment in new sectors is safe, that is one side of the picture. Investing in some sectors considering their potential factors based on connectivity with roads and metro and availability of facilities and utilities require little homework. A property investor can filter sectors of his choice on two basis \u2013 one on the basis of location of the project and its connectivity with the rest of the city and secondly on the basis of market credibility of the promoters developing the project in which you plan to invest. In the new sectors such as 79, 37, 65, 92, 93, 95 and others it is not difficult to do a bit of research or ground work about the real estate promoters who have delivered most of the projects timely and the allottees concerned are well satisfied. As a real estate promoter, the Signature Global in recent decades has done all efforts to win trust of property buyers cum investors and built its credibility in the real estate market. It also won the trust of the government. For a real estate promoter it is a big thing to claim honour from the government and also from the buyers \u2013 a buyer getting his\/her property on time as per the commitment made in the builder buyer agreement is a real anecdote. On such parameters of timely delivery of projects \u2013 residential or commercial \u2013 many projects are lagging behind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When it comes to investing in the real estate sector &#8211; in residential or commercial &#8211; location becomes a prime factor on what high return expectations are based.
