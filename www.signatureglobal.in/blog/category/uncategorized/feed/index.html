<br>



<p>Gurgaon has long been a focal point of India&#8217;s real estate sector, and this bustling city in the National Capital Region (NCR) has witnessed phenomenal urbanization and commercial growth in the past two to three decades. This is reflected in the indicators of real estate investments in every successive quarter—a significant boost for promoters, the state government, and a source of cheer for investors, signaling appreciation in land and property value.</p>



<br>



<p>Home to numerous multinational corporations and IT giants, Gurgaon&#8217;s presence not only drives demand for commercial real estate but also fuels the scope of residential development for employees seeking proximity to their workplaces.</p>



<br>



<p>The substantial investment in real estate is supported by massive investments in infrastructure projects, such as the Dwarka Expressway, RRTS, Indian Railway revamping of old railway stations, Sohna Road, and many others under consideration and at various stages. These developments have instilled faith in people regarding real estate investment, improving connectivity and making Gurgaon an attractive destination for real estate investments catering to the needs of the millennial workforce—forming a niche market within the real estate sector itself.</p>



<br>



<p>Real estate promoters have been focusing on budget-friendly housing projects to cater to a broader spectrum of property buyers, generating interest from investors. Next to Bengaluru, Mumbai, and Delhi, this millennium city has become a suitable and profitable market for foreign investment, particularly from global funds and private equity firms, due to its strategic location and potential for high returns.</p>



<br>



<p>The Indian real estate sector is undergoing a transition phase five years after the establishment of real estate regulatory bodies across the states. Gurgaon is the city within the state that has a separate RERA body, registering its immense potential, while the state’s main body is at Panchkula. It is not surprising that the Indian real estate sector has marked phenomenal investments during the third quarter of 2023, reflecting an 82 percent growth from the same period last year.</p>



<br>



<p>A superb sign is that the residential sector in the country attracted the highest institutional investments during this quarter, with the share for the industrial and warehousing sectors increasing to 28 percent in Q3 2023. In real estate terms, Mumbai, Bangalore, or other top cities have historically been real estate hotspots of India with high property prices and strong demand for commercial and residential properties. However, Gurgaon has gained an edge in the past few decades due to its relatively lower land prices, robust infrastructure development, and various job-oriented factors.</p>



<br>



<p>Close to the national capital and international airport, Gurgaon&#8217;s real estate funding in the latest quarter has been robust, largely driven by a combination of factors such as a strong corporate presence, infrastructure development, co-living and working trends, and budget-friendly housing initiatives by the government. Signature Global City, the most trustworthy real estate promoter, has marked a niche in shaping the housing needs of the city’s burgeoning population—especially low and mid-segment families.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-5 is-layout-flex">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="600" data-id="5259"  src="https://www.signatureglobal.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Industrial-blogs-2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5259"/></figure>

<br>



<p>The southern and northern peripheral roads serve as the lifeline of Gurugram, or what we might even call the new Gurugram—from sectors 58 to sectors 115, largely developed by the Haryana government in accordance with the latest Master Plan Gurugram Manesar Urban Complex 2031. The underlying concept behind designing this semi-circular road or expressway is to facilitate hassle-free commuting between Delhi and Gurugram, contributing to better urban planning through the seamless alignment of road, rail, and metro designs.</p>



<br>



<p>However, the intersection at Badshahpur, where SPR intersects with the Sohna Alwar road, has become a significant bottleneck over the past decade. Despite the presence of a flyover at this intersection, surface crossover remains a major hurdle in local traffic, turning commuting into a nightmare, with traffic management worsening day by day. Recognizing this issue, an underpass has been proposed in the detailed project report prepared by the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) as part of the re-strengthening of the 13-KM SPR—from Ghata Chowk to NH 48 near Kherki Daula.</p>



<br>



<p>This intersection has evolved into a crucial traffic point, connecting not only various internal sectors but also serving as a main connecting point for cities like Faridabad, Gurugram, Manesar, and Sohna. The traffic volume at this intersection has multiplied over the past decade, primarily due to the exponential growth in the real estate sector in Gurugram and Sohna. The NCR residents&#8217; preference for Gurugram, particularly the New Gurugram sectors, has led to a surge in property appreciation, both in terms of land and apartments.</p>



<br>



<p>Sohna Road and SPR have transformed into commercial corridors, with malls, multiplexes, retail shops, and SCOs sprouting up due to the increasing demand in the property sector. Real estate promoters are leaving no stone unturned to explore all options and capitalize on the growing urban scenario. The government has launched various financial schemes to assist low and mid-segment families, and new housing policies have been formulated. The NCR planning board and NHAI have committed to delivering road and rail infrastructure. During a recent visit, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal announced a metro line from Badshahpur Vatika Chowk to Pataudi, providing a significant boost to real estate appreciation.</p>



<br>



<p>Sohna, a suburb city of Gurugram, stands out as a galloping real estate hotspot, with the town planning department of Haryana actively supporting urban growth. The Sohna road, from Rajiv Chowk to Sohna, is rapidly emerging as an urban corridor. For prospective property buyers, it is advisable to trust a reliable promoter for a risk-free investment. The process involves a small exercise of navigating through the RERA website, as well as the website of TCP, Haryana, and then reviewing the projects of the promoter, delivered or under construction. Signature Global stands out as the most trustworthy real estate promoter, with its projects in Sohna and Gurgaon being non-compromising in terms of quality and adherence to green building norms.</p>

<br>



<p>The infrastructure serves as the foundation for the urban planning of an area. The concept involves designing a robust network of roads, rails, metros, water supply, sewage, electricity, schools, colleges, malls, markets, green spaces, and other amenities to create a city in harmony with available natural resources. Decades ago, great urban planners, architects, and the governments of the NCR invested considerable thought to extend Delhi’s population in all directions, ensuring seamless ambiance and connectivity. The result is evident today, with Gurugram emerging as the most promising zone, well-protected by the beautiful Aravalli range from the eastern side, providing a climate advantage for the urban population. While Aravalli extends a minimum of 55-60 KM from here, the hill range offers a suitable climate for building townships. The NHAI and the state government of Haryana constructed NPR, SPR, Sohna-Alwar Road, DMIC, and metro, making Sohna easily accessible, transforming daily commuting from a decade ago into a hassle-free experience. This achievement credits both the government and real estate promoters.</p>



<br>



<p>Now, from Vatika Chowk to Sohna, the corridor holds significant real estate potential following the construction of Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) and Sohna-Alwar Road. This is a noteworthy achievement. Regulatory bodies like Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA), Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), the NCR Planning Board, the Town and Country Planning (TCP) department of Haryana, and real estate representative bodies are working hard to coordinate and build a compatible urban culture and townships along these super expressways.</p>



<br>



<p>Launched in 2006 and 2017, DMIC and Sohna expressway have significantly catalyzed the transformation of real estate landscaping and urban planning in the entire district. Sohna Road and its surrounding areas stand out as prominent beneficiaries of this transformative initiative. The two projects aimed to create a high-impact industrial zone along the western Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC), in addition to National Highway-8 (now 48) and Sohna Road, connecting Delhi, Haryana, and Mumbai. This grand plan involved building state-of-the-art infrastructure, including logistics hubs, smart cities, and manufacturing zones.</p>



<br>



<p>Property prices and infrastructural development are on the rise, making it a perfect time to invest in property. However, thorough research into promoters’ credentials is essential. Among all real estate promoters, Signature Global has earned a name of repute for good quality constructions and adherence to green building norms.</p>

<br>



<p>Road and rail infrastructure drive the economy, and Gurgaon is blessed to have superb road infrastructure built by the state government and the Union, leading Gurgaon to become the economic capital of Haryana. In recent decades, the city has reshaped itself as the country’s center of trade, both domestic and international, with Maruti, Flipkart, AIIMS, Global City, Jungle Safari, and many other developments making this city an iconic place globally.</p>



<br>



<p>Let us remember that superb road infrastructure has played a pivotal role in accelerating economic activities in various industries such as automobile, garment, IT, the service sector, and real estate, leading the business to grow significantly in Gurgaon. Currently, as many as six major roads, highways, or expressways intersect this district, facilitating seamless travel and transportation, which forms the basis of the city&#8217;s economic growth. These roads include NH 48, Sohna Alwar, Delhi Mumbai, KMP, Northern, and Southern Peripheral Roads. Dwarka Expressway is one of the main arterial roads connecting the city to the suburbs and neighboring states.</p>



<br>



<p>Now, there is a pressing need to connect Dwarka Expressway with KMP via Chandu, Badsa, and Patli. Along its alignment, significant establishments such as Badsa AIIMS, Sultanpur Sanctuary, Patli dry-port, a 60-bedded Sheetla Mata hospital, and world-class business establishments are proposed to come up. Therefore, non-stop connectivity is the need of the day so that these top establishments can have direct access to the national capital and the international airport.</p>



<br>



<p>To address this need, the state government has decided to construct a six-lane road that will prove to be a boon to the areas falling in the alignments of Dwarka Expressway and KMP Expressway. This six-lane road will not only provide seamless commuting between Hero Honda Chowk (NH-48) and KMP near Badsa but also reactivate real estate constructions in both housing and commercial terms. The road will bridge the gap between AIIMS healthcare and accessibility, allowing people from Delhi NCR and other states to easily reach the hospital and avail its specialties.</p>



<br>



<p>This 8-9 KM long six-lane road will offer government opportunities to carve out new sectors through the development of new master plans, while real estate promoters can build new housing projects and commercial spaces. The news of this six-lane road has spread rapidly. The lands between KMP and Dwarka Expressway, primarily agricultural, are ready to accept and adopt changing urban development for a better tomorrow and quality living for future generations. A significant number of job opportunities are expected to open up in a very short span of time. This is a well-thought-out plan by the state government.</p>

<br>



<p>The catalyst for Gurgaon&#8217;s real estate boom was the opening of the much-awaited Delhi-Gurgaon-Jaipur Expressway (NH-48) back in 2008. This four-lane arterial road reduced commuting times between Delhi, Gurgaon, and Rewari, providing people easy access to the International Airport—a much-needed requirement from a business perspective. This put economic activities in full gear, and Gurgaon&#8217;s land became gold mines. It&#8217;s not unfair to say that businesses flocked to Gurgaon, attracted by its proximity to the national capital and world-class infrastructure. This shift was a microcosm of India&#8217;s real estate revolution—a journey that would propel the nation&#8217;s real estate industry to a $5.8 trillion behemoth by 2047. Gurgaon witnessed maximum growth in this regard; its potential was truly recognized, and multinational corporations and IT giants began setting up units in this burgeoning city, fueling demand for office spaces and, consequently, residential complexes for the growing workforce and uncontrolled population.</p>



<br>



<p>With businesses flourishing, Gurgaon now became the epicenter of the construction frenzy. Skyscrapers began to sprout like anything else, transforming the city&#8217;s skyline, followed by mushrooming residential projects offering modern amenities. The government&#8217;s pro-business policies, in the form of slogans such as Make in India, Ease of Doing Business, as well as easing out foreign investment regulations, further fueled real estate growth beyond expectations. Foreign direct investment poured in, funding mega townships and industrial hubs across big cities, and Gurgaon, in particular, emerged as a big hotspot for real estate investors, both domestic and international, and property seekers alike. With the dawn of a new era, the city recognized the importance of sustainable development. Green buildings, rainwater harvesting, and solar panels became commonplace features in real estate projects, with promoters in Gurgaon playing a pivotal role in this regard—Signature Global is one such promoter that adopted these developments, setting new standards for urban planning and environmental responsibility.</p>



<br>



<p>The Gurgaon real estate market wasn&#8217;t without its challenges. Traffic congestion and inadequate public transport systems became major issues as the city&#8217;s population exploded. However, the government responded with ambitious plans to expand metro connectivity and improve road infrastructure. These initiatives not only addressed transportation woes but also opened up new areas for development, further boosting the real estate sector. As Gurgaon prospered, it attracted a diverse population from all corners of India and the world. The city&#8217;s cosmopolitan culture and thriving social scene made it a magnet for young professionals and families alike. This demographic shift had a profound impact on the types of properties demanded, leading to the development of plotted townships, luxury villas, and mixed-use developments catering to diverse lifestyles.</p>



<br>



<p>However, this growth wasn&#8217;t without its challenges, as sustainability remained a pressing concern, with the city grappling with water scarcity and air pollution. Yet, real estate sector promoters like Signature Global responded with innovations and sustainable goals. The catalyst for change came with ambitious urban planning initiatives across the country, and so the adaptability of the changing developments and their quick response systems by the promoters made India a big real estate hub of the world to achieve the target of a $5.8 trillion industry by 2047.</p>

<br>



<p>The Haryana government has made a commendable decision in favor of residents who wish to start their businesses independently by purchasing individual floors. The state government has now allowed the registration of independent floors on commercial plots in licensed colonies. This move is welcomed, as it conveys a noble and pro-entrepreneur message aimed at stimulating economic activities. It is apt and responds to the growing demand in the market.</p>



<br>



<p>In real estate terms, this decision will significantly foster the growth of the commercial real estate segment. It will create demand, leading to an increase in the prices of residential plots, as the decision allows people to open offices or commercial spaces on these floors, thereby driving up rental values. The government believes that this move will empower professionals to own offices and start their businesses stress-free from these independent floors.</p>



<br>



<p>Now, buyers or investors can purchase parts of buildings for self-use or leasing and get the properties registered, allowing for complete freedom from leasing or renting, resembling a form of temporary settlement. Investors and promoters alike have praised this decision, as it represents a forward-looking approach that will stimulate investment and business growth in the state.</p>



<br>



<p>The state government has carefully considered this decision, believing it will unlock opportunities for businesses, investors, and entrepreneurs, attracting both local and global enterprises and establishing the state as an investment hotspot.</p>



<br>



<p>Gurugram will benefit significantly from this decision, being a hub of commerce and innovation. Licensed colonies have always been the preferred choice for businesses due to their well-planned infrastructure, connectivity, and proximity to major markets, making them ideal locations for commercial ventures. However, the scarcity of suitable commercial spaces in licensed colonies has been a persistent issue, making it challenging for entrepreneurs to secure the right kind of space at an affordable price. As more independent floors are transformed into commercial units, licensed colonies have undergone a remarkable transformation. Cafes, co-working spaces, boutiques, and small offices have flourished in what were once purely residential areas. The sense of community and economic activity in these colonies has grown stronger, attracting even more businesses. Let us not forget that Gurgaon, which is primarily a licensed city, has transformed into a vibrant business hub in recent years.</p>

<br>



<p>Gurgaon is one of the leading real estate destinations in our country, and its common knowledge that the real estate sector has emerged as a sector of great importance for various reasons, especially in recent years. As we know, affordable housing in Gurgaon has become a significant trend among the low and mid-segment class, who largely constitute the end-users. Even during periods of sluggishness in the property sector and a drop in overall property demand in real estate, the demand for affordable housing in Gurgaon and other parts of NCR has remained relatively stable. This reflects that a large section of the society in Gurgaon still resides in rented houses due to their inability to afford houses in premium societies, primarily because of the high property prices.</p>



<br>



<p>There is no doubt that affordable housing has emerged as a much better option for the low and mid-segment population compared to luxurious housing in Gurgaon, a cosmopolitan city where property prices are skyrocketing. The affordability of residential properties also makes them attractive for rental prospects. The Haryana state government had to address the issue of housing for all, which was a pressing need, as Gurgaon experienced a massive population explosion with more than two lakh people settling in the city every successive year. This population influx strained existing infrastructure and led to the proliferation of illegal colonies, tarnishing the city&#8217;s reputation as a city of skyscrapers.</p>



<br>



<p>Initially launched to provide cheaper homes to low- and mid-income families, the affordable housing scheme is now facing significant challenges. Homebuyers are increasingly turning away from the affordable housing segment, causing its share in the overall residential real estate market to steadily decline. This decline can be attributed to multiple factors, including the fact that the facilities in residential housing societies governed by the affordable housing policy are notably less in comparison to non-affordable societies. Affordable societies also tend to have a much higher population density, leading to concerns such as vehicle parking and maintenance disputes. Despite the government granting relaxations to real estate developers under the affordable housing policy, rising land and construction material prices are major constraints for builders.</p>



<br>



<p>In response to these challenges, the Haryana state government has significantly increased the cap to attract developers to build houses within a budget range suitable for the low and mid-segment population, which constitutes a substantial part of the city&#8217;s population. To strike a balance between skyscrapers and low-rise buildings, the government has allowed for stilt-plus-four-story construction on independent land in budget-friendly developments.</p>



<br>



<p><a href="https://www.signatureglobal.in/"><u><strong><u>Signature Global</u></strong></u></a>, a trusted real estate developer in Gurgaon, has been at the forefront of addressing the housing needs of this significant section of the society and continues to lead the city in this regard.</p>

<br>



<p>Not all, but many cities in the country have witnessed rapid growth in recent decades, and Gurgaon is one that has emerged as a top global city, attracting global investors. It has become a political, industrial, and IT hub, which is a positive sign in terms of potential revenue. This has also piqued the interest of both the state and the Centre, leading them to give it special consideration. Gurgaon has also offered a lucrative business and residential settlement option for both common individuals and real estate promoters, both in terms of business opportunities and job prospects. These two important factors have led to an unbelievable population growth.</p>



<br>



<p>From a rickshaw-puller to a chief executive officer (CEO) of a branded company, from a big businessperson to a bureaucrat and politician, every individual aspires to have a residence, flat, apartment, plot, villa, or duplex in this city, along with a business setup. This clearly indicates that Gurgaon is a real estate hotspot, and everyone, from the poor to the rich, has the opportunity to reside and settle here for a better future.</p>



<br>



<p>A significant change has been observed in the buyers&#8217; mindset in the past decade – a paradigm shift, to be precise. Nowadays, property buyers not only want to purchase residential plots or flats but also desire to invest in businesses where their individual integrity and interests remain secure. This is the reason the state government has opened up new avenues for revenue generation by allowing independent floor registry for commercial units in builder areas or licensed colonies. Gurgaon needed this move urgently as it is a high-potential commercial and residential zone. Whether it&#8217;s commercial real estate properties or residential assets, property buyers now see them as worthy investments, which was not the case in the past or until a decade ago. The idea of generating regular income from a secure property investment has attracted many small-time investors.</p>



<br>



<p>The demand for properties such as shop-cum-offices (SCOs), retail shops, malls, and other markets is on the rise, and people are investing in these properties. While residential assets are illiquid, immovable, and appreciate in value, commercial assets have become increasingly appealing to buyers in the post-pandemic era. In the midst of this frenzied lifestyle, homebuyers have begun to closely analyze shifts in the real estate market, considering factors such as affordability, connectivity, and quality of life.</p>



<br>



<p>Today&#8217;s property buyers are much more demanding, cautious, and conscious compared to buyers in the past, whose primary focus was simply buying a residential unit and finding a peaceful job. The real estate market has adapted to meet these changing needs. <a href="https://www.signatureglobal.in/"><u><strong><u>Signature Global</u></strong></u></a>, a trustworthy real estate promoter, has successfully met the evolving needs of property buyers in a diligent manner.</p>

<br>



<p>A boom in India&#8217;s real estate sector is a recent decades-old phenomenon, with people from remote areas flocking towards cities in search of jobs, a better life, and a brighter future. This scenario has had a positive impact on the country&#8217;s economy. Delhi NCR, Bangalore, Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai, and others are good examples of rising urban cities in terms of economic activities and real estate as well. The point in question is that the real estate sector, among all the other high-potential economic activities, has emerged as the most sumptuous business activity. Its rapid growth in a short span of time and its prominence have involved multiple challenges as well. The government felt the need to address these challenges and streamline the real estate sector from time to time, as this sector directly impacts the country&#8217;s common man.</p>



<br>



<p>Long before the conception of the Real Estate (Regulations and Development) Act, the Reserve Bank of India began taking note of housing prices in urban areas that involved huge loans and interest rates for homes. The Housing Price Index is the result of the RBI&#8217;s routine exercise since then to scale the growth and its rising price graph.</p>



<br>



<p>The Housing Price Index is a quarterly report by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) based on the all-India price movement, using data collected from a few top urban cities. The indices are based on official data of property price transactions obtained from the respective state governments&#8217; registration authorities.</p>



<br>



<p>Upon closer observation of the year-on-year housing price trends, it is apparent that the rising housing demand in urban cities has influenced housing prices. Let&#8217;s take a look at the recent quarters&#8217; growth to better understand the subject and decide if it&#8217;s the right time to invest in property. We observe that the all-India House Price Index rose by 5.1 percent in the April-June quarter of 2023-24, compared to 3.4 percent a year ago, according to data released by the Reserve Bank of India. The RBI releases its quarterly data based on transaction-level data it receives from the respective registration authorities of major cities in the country, with the highest growth seen in Delhi NCR.</p>



<br>



<p>One crucial note here is that home prices are evidently rising in urban cities in our country despite the hike in interest rates by the Reserve Bank of India to combat inflation. This indicates that the continuing price rise, influenced by high interest rates on home loans across the metro cities, is not a deterrent. This suggests that the country&#8217;s economy is growing, and people are cautious about their life, education, and living conditions.</p>

<p>Gurugram is one such top city among others that has witnessed remarkable population growth, along with a surge in housing demand. Gurugram&#8217;s population has grown on average by two lakhs per year in recent decades alone. This rapid population growth has influenced housing demand, leading to rising home loans and interest rates, which, in turn, have energized economic activities. This is the reason Gurugram is now among the few top cities in the world in terms of real estate and economic activities, including businesses and industries.</p>
