The emergence of the real estate sector in other cities of India, including Gurugram, marks the beginning of a prosperous business trade for high returns on investments. If we examine the real estate growth in Gurugram, a unique feature of this city comes to light. Geographically, it is located at the center of the country with its proximity to the beautiful Aravalli forest in the southern direction of the national capital, Delhi, as well as to the international airport. This advantageous location has significantly contributed to economic activities, including real estate growth, in comparison to other cities in the country. Gurugram is often considered an extension of the national capital or an offshoot of it. While cities like Noida, another extension of the national capital, have also witnessed growth in the real estate market, it doesn&#8217;t quite match the level of Gurugram&#8217;s property appreciation for flats, plots, shops, and more. The property values are approximately two times higher in Gurugram compared to neighboring cities such as Noida, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, and others, supported by superb infrastructure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from these advantages in the real estate sector, Gurugram is a focal point for job opportunities. People from across the country, primarily from North India, view this city as a substitute for Delhi, especially the lower and middle segments of the salaried class. They have come here, purchased plots using their hard-earned money, and settled with hopes of a better life and future for the next generation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider that the population of this city was merely 14 lakhs ten or more years ago, which has now crossed the figure of 30 lakhs. Most people aspire to settle in Gurugram, causing a shortage of housing options. In response, the state government has introduced housing policies from time to time to accommodate the low and middle segments, aiming to provide roofs overhead while also curbing the proliferation of unauthorized colonies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>Hence, the latest data indicating high demand in the real estate sector against limited supply is not an unprecedented phenomenon. One important reason is that Gurugram&#8217;s growing population in the post-pandemic era recognized the need for housing and bought small one, two, or three-bedroom flats within their budget, avoiding unauthorized colonies. This trend has led to an increase in demand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, not only have low- and middle-segment investors driven the housing demand, but promoters also pursued licenses from relevant departments to activate the real estate market commercially. This has led to the rise of malls, Shop Cum Office (SCO) plots, and other commercial establishments. This dynamic business environment is attractive for investors seeking high returns on investment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that Gurugram has an independent real estate authority unlike other cities in India, which highlights its real estate potential. This authority has been established to ensure a balanced relationship between allottees and real estate promoters. Real estate promoters are now closely monitored for any violations by the authority, which might have slowed down output, but for good reasons. This approach benefits both real estate promoters and prospective property buyers by fostering a fair real estate sector and honest companies like Signature Global, which have experienced rapid growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, the data from PropIndex (Q2 2023-24 by Magic Bricks) indicating a 28.9% quarter-on-quarter growth in demand for properties in Gurgaon can be largely attributed to its outstanding real estate image. Additionally, the surge in demand can also be credited to Gurgaon&#8217;s reputation as a commercial and technological hub, attracting a considerable workforce in search of quality housing options. The strategic connectivity, emerging employment hubs, and affordability have positioned Gurgaon as a prime hotspot for property seekers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, this is the perfect time for investing in commercial and residential properties in the new Gurugram and Sohna areas. Projects developed by Signature Global, as mentioned above, ensure a good return on your investment.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In terms of real estate growth in India, Gurugram has established a reputation that cannot be denied today.
