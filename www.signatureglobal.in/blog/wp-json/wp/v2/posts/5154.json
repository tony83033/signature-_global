Once the Indian Railways revamps the railway station the prices of land, flats, floors etc will shoot up from the existing prices since low and mid segment service class people would find job opportunities in Gurugram and settle permanently in this city as well. Those currently travel daily from Delhi, Bahadurgarh, Ghaziabad for their job purposes they would find a permanent place of living.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>What revamping would mean?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>Revamping Gurugram railway station is a perfect plan and need of the hour. Gurugram railway station is currently used by people who travel daily to and fro from Rewari and Delhi via Gurugram but it is largely of no use for the residents of urban Gurugram. The station is not well connected with most parts of the city and located at a congested place with no or less parking space available and not maintained. About the local trains plying between Rewari and Delhi very few people of urban Gurugram know and people better use the metro which itself is poorly connected with remote parts of the city.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many advantages of traveling in the local trains of Indian Railways. It is cheaper in ticket prices compared to the metro but people are less familiar. However, the demand to revamp the city\u2019s prime railway station as well as main bus stand remained unaddressed. At Gurugram railway station no long distance trains \u2013 between Delhi and Rajasthan \u2013 stop here and people are forced to board those trains at Delhi railway station only. But revamping would mean beautification of the station and ease of accessibility.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>How would it boost economic activities in Gurugram?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>The rail as well as the road is the lifeline of a city. Gurgaon is rich in roads and highways but it is very poor in terms of metro and rail for local commuting. The DMRC built a metro long back and its extension is pending since then. The rail is always considered a better mode of transport compared to the roadways. The local trains plying on this section are less used by urban residents which is why the government for long had been planning for revamping railway stations to make it easily accessible for urban Gurgaon by redesigning the stations and connectivity to make it integral part of communication to and fro from Delhi and vice versa. Upgraded railway stations will certainly draw global attention and attract more trains to run to meet daily needs between Delhi Gurgaon and Rewari and further for commuting and business purposes. The revamping will boost tourism, business travel, and trade, making the district more accessible for the people from other regions. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/residential\/premium\/\"><u><strong><u>Signature Global<\/u><\/strong><\/u><\/a>, the city&#8217;s premier real estate developer, has earned the trust of property buyers through the successful delivery of their multiple projects, making them a dependable choice for substantial returns on investment.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Revamping plan of Gurugram railway station will transform daily commuting in the entire national capital region to an unbelievable extent.
