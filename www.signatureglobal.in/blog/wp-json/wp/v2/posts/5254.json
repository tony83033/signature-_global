The concept involves designing a robust network of roads, rails, metros, water supply, sewage, electricity, schools, colleges, malls, markets, green spaces, and other amenities to create a city in harmony with available natural resources. Decades ago, great urban planners, architects, and the governments of the NCR invested considerable thought to extend Delhi\u2019s population in all directions, ensuring seamless ambiance and connectivity. The result is evident today, with Gurugram emerging as the most promising zone, well-protected by the beautiful Aravalli range from the eastern side, providing a climate advantage for the urban population. While Aravalli extends a minimum of 55-60 KM from here, the hill range offers a suitable climate for building townships. The NHAI and the state government of Haryana constructed NPR, SPR, Sohna-Alwar Road, DMIC, and metro, making Sohna easily accessible, transforming daily commuting from a decade ago into a hassle-free experience. This achievement credits both the government and real estate promoters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, from Vatika Chowk to Sohna, the corridor holds significant real estate potential following the construction of Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) and Sohna-Alwar Road. This is a noteworthy achievement. Regulatory bodies like Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA), Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), the NCR Planning Board, the Town and Country Planning (TCP) department of Haryana, and real estate representative bodies are working hard to coordinate and build a compatible urban culture and townships along these super expressways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>Launched in 2006 and 2017, DMIC and Sohna expressway have significantly catalyzed the transformation of real estate landscaping and urban planning in the entire district. Sohna Road and its surrounding areas stand out as prominent beneficiaries of this transformative initiative. The two projects aimed to create a high-impact industrial zone along the western Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC), in addition to National Highway-8 (now 48) and Sohna Road, connecting Delhi, Haryana, and Mumbai. This grand plan involved building state-of-the-art infrastructure, including logistics hubs, smart cities, and manufacturing zones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>Property prices and infrastructural development are on the rise, making it a perfect time to invest in property. However, thorough research into promoters\u2019 credentials is essential. Among all real estate promoters, Signature Global has earned a name of repute for good quality constructions and adherence to green building norms.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The infrastructure serves as the foundation for the urban planning of an area.
