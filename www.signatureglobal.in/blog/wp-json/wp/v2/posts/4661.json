The RRTS is a wonderful development of the national capital region (NCR) and it is certain to bring about generational transformation in many ways in people\u2019s life and their living standard, as major attention of the NCR planning board is to make Gurugram centre of attraction as all focus is on development of roads, water, sewer, environment etc at war footage. Let&#8217;s not forget that Gurugram is the NCR\u2019s major part and the board has to take into consideration a holistic view in terms of development of all the districts of the NCR and Gurugram is the key attraction centre with a lot more urban development scope in the new sectors. The high speed rail corridor such as RRTS, thus, is being developed with a holistic view by the NCR planning board \u2013 and investments in these sectors are trending people think the corridor such as Delhi Alwar SNB &#8211; Shahjahanpur Neemrana Behror will uplift the image of new sectors of Gurugram.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>The old sectors of Gurugram were shaped years ago with MG Road, Golf Course Road rapid metro etc now these new sectors especially sectors 77 to 93 are getting prominence these days after infrastructure developments. This high speed rail corridor will reduce the travel time between Delhi and Alwar from four hours to two hours making commuting easy and comfortable, less tiresome and help improve living standard of people in these sectors and help develop an urban corridor also alongside with a beautiful theme and design unlike old dense clusters of old Gurugram. This high speed rail corridor will give Gurugram a maximum exposure to property seekers from across the country and to worldwide to invest in premium projects being developed by Signature Global and others. This high speed rail corridor is believed to transform the urban ambience between Gurugram and Alwar via Sohna, Rewari, Dharuhera, Bhiwadi etc in time to come. And it is also said that all tehsils of district Gurugram such as Pataudi Farukhnagr Sohna and Gurugram itself will get its positive impact in real estate and other ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting from Sarai Kale Khan in New Delhi, the RRTS line enters Gurugram at Kapashera border to Atul Kataria Chowk to Signature to Rajiv Chowk and then Kherki Daula toll on NH 48 and then it goes straight underground through the thick Aravalli forest nearly five seven kilometres. So reaching Sohna, Pataudi or Farukhnagar from Delhi would become easy in time to come or by 2024 when it is expected to be partially operational as it will reduce travel time. Using RRTS at Delhi one can reach Sohna, Pataudi, Rewari, Farukhnagar, Rewari, Dharuhera conveniently compare to tiresome travelling as on date and that is the whole purpose of the board to make travel easy in entire NCR belt with<br>aim to improve living standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>And buying a property in the four tehsils of district Gurugram is trending currently since commuting has become hassle free after opening of Gurrugram Sohna expressway, KMP and Delhi Mumbai corridor etc and now RRTS is to make commuting much easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>Investing money in buying a property whether for investment or non investment purposes in the four tehsils of district Gurugram is believed to be a wise planning, reason it is to prove profitable investments \u2013 these areas are potentially high in revenue terms and also in terms of quality education, health etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>The Delhi-Alwar RRTS corridor is being developed in phases &#8211; 107-km-long SNB Urban Complex (Shahjahanpur-Neemrana-Behror) will link Gurgaon, Manesar, Panchgaon, and Rewari making commuting easy. A lot more opportunity to come in the residential and commercial real estate sector \u2013 individual floors, plots or affordable housing villas that the Haryana government is mulling to come up with along these road and rail corridors in future. The project will also have a positive impact on the environment by reducing air pollution.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The regional rapid transit system (RRTS) will prove a befitting need of Gurugram especially for the new sectors such as 77 to 93 being close to its route and many property seekers aspire to buy or invest in land, plot, floors is reality of the day today.
