It is a dream come true project, and only a small portion of it has been opened for traffic recently. Sohna, a sub-city of Gurgaon, will benefit greatly from this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s review Sohna. Years ago, the Department of Town and Country Planning created its Master Plan 2031 to provide a vision and regulations for growth and construction activity in the town of Sohna in Haryana. Accordingly, the department designated lands for real estate development, residential, and commercial projects in Sohna, which marked phenomenal growth in the past few decades. Sohna&#8217;s growth picked up after the Kundli Manesar Palwal (KMP) was put into operation, followed by the recent opening of the Gurgaon Alwar expressway. Moreover, the opening of the 246-km Sohna-Dausa section of the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor has not only made traveling easy but also opened opportunities in the real estate sector, industrial sector, warehousing, logistics, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Considering Sohna&#8217;s immense potential, many private real estate promoters have launched projects, and the Haryana government is gearing up to provide civic infrastructure to help the city improve rapidly. Also, the state government of Haryana is trying its best to attract investors to set up industries in Sohna, which is now well-connected with highways and expressways. Sohna is no longer the underdeveloped suburb it was perceived to be a decade or two ago. In the post-pandemic era, the demand for luxury homes has gained momentum, and this is evident from the projects launched in recent years. These factors have led to significant interest across several micro-markets and suburbs in the National Capital Region, of which suburbs such as Sohna emerged as real estate hotspots in Gurgaon. The travel time from Gurgaon to Sohna is hardly twenty to twenty-five minutes. TCP is paying attention to woo real estate promoters and homebuyers focusing on a high percentage of open spaces and green belts in planning. Sohna is blessed with eco-sensitive Aravalis and a lake, among others that surround several real estate and infrastructure developments in this suburb. The opening of the Sohna-Dausa stretch will accelerate development growth in Sohna and Gurgaon. Signature Global, a real estate promoter, has launched projects in Sohna, offering luxury homes available in pocket-friendly budgets.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) is a significant boon for the entire country because it will connect the north and south and help accelerate business, industry, and the economy.
