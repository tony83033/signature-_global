This city as reported by few such agencies has marked superb progress in terms of real estate property prices in recent few years only which is evident that there is a lot of attraction people have for Gurugram. Obviously, this city is a hub of information technology (IT) and automobile and garment industries attracting finest and largest job opportunities to people and thereby it is a big boost to the real estate market. A decade ago, there were few real estate promoters interested in launching projects in Gurugram and they occupied much of the city&#8217;s land but\u00a0today\u00a0there are hundreds of real estate promoters and thousands of real estate projects obtained licence from the Haryana government. The government realized the city&#8217;s potential to put this city in a high potential real estate zone. The government revised collector rate twice a year \u2013 since the city is a high potential real estate hub.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>The city has witnessed a steep rise in residential housing from the mid-segment service class people and the government formed an affordable housing policy in 2013 and has revised twice since then. The property cum land prices in this policy was capped Rs 4000 per square feet initially and it was revised to Rs 4200 per square feet a few years ago and now it has been revised to Rs 5000 per square feet by the government.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>In the recently released report titled &#8216;Real Insight Residential \u2013 April-June 2023&#8217; by PropTiger.com, a leading digital real estate brokerage company and a part of REA India, which also owns Housing.com and Makaan.com, it was shown that the weighted average price of residential properties across eight major Indian cities reached Rs 7,000-7,200 per square foot during the April-June period. This is a 6% increase compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. The report provides valuable insights into the current state of the real estate market in India&#8217;s key cities. Gurugram marks fabulous growth of twelve percent in this regard \u2013 highest among all the cities is a matter of pride. The markets covered in the report include Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Delhi-National Capital Region and Pune.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>And it has been observed a conspicuous rise in housing demand mainly from the low and mid-segment service class people in the post Covid-19 pandemic era that reflects people are concerned of the safety of their families which is a good sign of real estate progress in Gurugram and other cities in the country.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Housing prices have been climbing in major Indian cities in the post-COVID years. While this upward trend in capital values is attracting investors to India&#8217;s key real estate markets, the increase in new supply is helping to moderate price increases,&#8221; said a statement issued by REA India.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurugram\u2019s real estate promoter\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.signatureglobal.in\/residential\/premium\/\"><u><strong><u>Signature Global<\/u><\/strong><\/u><\/a> has delivered maximum real estate projects in Gurugram in the past ten years marking its strong and convincing presence in the real estate market true to the expectation of the property buyers.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are many real estate assessment agencies active in the country and in their assessment reports Gurugram is on top always.
