<p>Housing sales in Gurugram jumped more than three-fold on an annual basis to 24,482 units during January September this year on higher demand for <strong><a href="https://www.signatureglobal.in/residential/">residential properties</a></strong> across all price categories &#8212; affordable, mid-income and luxury, according to Anarock.</p>



<p>Housing sales in Gurugram stood at 7,725 units in the year ago period.</p>



<p>“Housing sales in Gurugram have risen sharply this year because of higher demand across all price points and segments, be it affordable housing or <strong><a href="https://www.signatureglobal.in/residential/premium/">luxury floors</a></strong>. Of late, builders have also launched many projects with better locations and amenities which is attracting home buyers.” Signature Global, which is mainly into the development of <strong><a href="https://www.signatureglobal.in/residential/affordable/">affordable housing projects</a></strong>, had in July filed a draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) with market regulator Sebi to raise Rs. 1,000 crore- quoted, <strong><a href="https://www.signatureglobal.in/about-us.php">Mr. Pradeep Kumar Aggarwal, Founder and Chairman, Signatureglobal (India) Limited</a></strong>.</p>

<p>With the Gurgaon-Jaipur stretch of the mega 1352 km long Delhi-Gurgaon-Mumbai expressway getting operational later this month, the South of Gurgaon (Sohna) real estate is set to get a major boost.</p>



<p>This 8-lane access-controlled expressway will fast-track Gurgaon-Sohna-Jaipur connectivity, by effectively reducing the travelling time to Jaipur to two and a half hours. Gurgaon-Sohna-Jaipur stretch of the Delhi-Mumbai expressway is the first corridor to get operational. This will follow the operationalization of the crucial six-lane elevated access-controlled expressway between Rajiv Chowk (NH8 Gurgaon) and Sohna. This elevated road has already provided a great connectivity boost to Sohna&#8217;s real estate micro market.</p>



<p>The National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) is now further revamping the Sohna elevated expressway through a slip road and an underpass at Vatika Chowk, where Sohna Road intersects Southern Peripheral Road (SPR). This will put an end to congestion and ensure smooth and speedier traffic on the premier real estate corridor of the National Capital Region (NCR), benefitting hundreds of thousands of people living in residential societies on both sides of the expressway.</p>



<p>Sohna, which already enjoys the advantage of strategic location due to close connectivity with NH8, NH248A, and Kundli-Manesar-Palwal expressway, will get further boost with improved connectivity. This will prove to be a booster for the logistics and warehousing business which has already taken roots in the region. Also, once the work on the DND and Jewar Airport, and Greater Noida links get completed in a couple of years, the entire NCR including Gurgaon, Sohna, Faridabad, Noida and Greater Noida will get immensely benefited in terms of real estate development.<gwmw style="display:none;"></p>

<p>The significant growth in retail credit for home buyers, and corporate credit to real estate companies, will have a positive impact on the growth of real estate, particularly in general and residential real estate.</p>



<p>Both the bank credit and non-bank (NBFCs) credit for home buyers and real estate/ construction companies has seen the fastest growth. According to industry statistics, the credit for companies/industries grew the fastest in September 2022, due to a surge in demand for working capital over the past eight years.</p>



<p>The Reserve Bank of India&#8217;s (RBI) latest sectoral deployment data indicates that the credit to industries/corporates has shot up to Rs 32.4 trillion, registering a 12.6 percent year on year growth. The RBI&#8217;s figures indicate that the construction companies and allied sector companies dealing in steel and cement are the key drivers of credit growth. Post-Covid, the working capital loans that had contracted during the pandemic, are now on the rise. In view of the turbulent stock market, companies have been preferring bank credit and loans from NBFCs. High inflation had resulted in higher demand for working capital loans from companies. Public sector banks saw the aggregate loan growth improve to 8.8 percent in the financial year 2022, the highest since 2013-14.</p>



<p>On one hand, the corporate loan book is swelling, while on the other, retail loan (largely home loan) is significantly increasing. HDFC, the largest private mortgage financer, has seen its retail loan demand at an 8-year high. In Q2 2022, individual disbursements were to the tune of Rs 43000 crore, up by 2 percent sequentially and 13 percent, year on year. Disbursements in the individual segment grew by 36 percent year on year to Rs 44000 crore. Individual loans comprise 81 percent of the Rs 6.9 trillion of assets under management(AUM). State Bank of India, the leading public sector bank, has seen retail loans growing by 18.84 percent, while corporate loans registering a growth of 21.8 percent.</p>



<p>NBFCs and HFCs have also seen a spurt in retail loans and home loans, with strong demand from Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. LIC Housing Finance is leveraging high demand for the affordable housing segment. It has an overall loan growth guidance of 15 percent across the full financial year. In view of the robust demand from Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, Sundram Home Finance is raising up to Rs 4500 crore to expand its loan book. It aims to disburse Rs 3500 crore in the current fiscal, up from Rs 2350 crore in the last financial year.</p>



<p>What is all the more heartening is that unlike in the past, credit growth this time is quite broad based. According to leading rating agency Crisil, healthy economic growth and budgetary support from the government should further provide a push to bank credit growth by 2-3 percent to 11-12 percent in 2022-23. Thus, this high credit demand from corporates and home buyers will bode well for the real estate, especially the residential segment.<gwmw style="display:none;"></p>

<p>Despite being prone to rising interest regime, the rate sensitive real estate sector, particularly residential realty is experiencing robust sales due to strong sentiment for home ownership, rising number of new launches amidst manageable inventory.</p>



<p>The healthy residential sales momentum is marked by the highest sales number for residential real estate after 2010. The January- September 2022 period registered sales of 161000 units and the projections for the full year top 2000000 units. This according to JLL, will be 56 percent higher than last year&#8217;s sales figure. As per Anarock data, sales of residential properties across top 7 cities including Delhi-NCR, Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) , Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Pune and Hyderabad rose 41 percent year on year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This positive performance is reflected in the equity shares of real estate companies as well. Against an 8 percent surge in Nifty 50 and S&amp;P BSE Index , shares of top listed companies have gone up by over 28 percent in the July- September quarter. Seen in the backdrop of&nbsp; firming up of interest rates and up to 10 percent&nbsp; increase in home prices across a portfolio of projects , this is quite creditable&nbsp;performance.</p>



<p>The robust home sales amidst high demand&nbsp; and reducing inventory ,are reflected in a healthy increase in the number of new launches.&nbsp; The top 7 cities witnessed new launches of&nbsp; 62000 apartments in the third quarter of 2022, recording an increase of 3 percent QoQ , as per JLL report findings. What is significant about these new launches is that developers are tailoring their projects as per the choice and preferences of home buyers. Keeping in view the post-covid requirements of spacious premium homes with top amenities and high quotient of sustainability and wellness , developers are offering such products to lure prospective home buyers. And these tailor-made&nbsp; products with lucrative launch&nbsp;offers , in turn are pushing up housing demand and sales.</p>



<p>As the new supply by the developers across India is getting a very good response, developers have planned a strong pipeline of&nbsp; new launches in millions of sq ft, beyond festive season to cash in on the sales momentum. Especially when the trend of home ownership is gaining further strength. As such despite hiccups, a strong finish is expected in the second half of the year which will help continue the momentum through the new year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>NRIS are turning out to be the biggest drivers of housing sales in the National Capital Region., in turn boosting the growth prospects of real estate as a whole.</p>



<p>A latest CII &#8211; Anarock&nbsp; consumer sentiment survey shows that NCR (particularly Gurgaon and Noida) is the preferred choice of NRIs for housing investment along with Hyderabad and Bangalore. As many as 60 percent NRIs, mostly from countries like the Gulf, USA, Canada and various Asian countries want to buy homes in these three Indian cities.&nbsp; Over 20 percent of all NRI home buyers are inclined to invest in the NCR.</p>



<p>Post- Covid pandemic, securing homes in India has become a priority for overseas Indians. They have been preferring&nbsp;bigger and spacious residential properties from the safety and privacy point of view. Because of this consideration, low-rise independent luxury floors of 3-4 bed rooms in gated communities , have gained popularity among NRIs.Despite hardening of interest rates, the depreciating&nbsp;rupee value against the US dollar&nbsp; gives NRIs a distinct advantage to invest in Indian residential property.</p>



<p>As a result of all this, housing has seen a 15-20 percent increase in NRI demand in the first nine months of 2022, compared to the corresponding period last year. NRIs bought over 50000 of the 2.73 lakh homes sold in the top 7 cities during the January- September 2022 period. These included those NRIs who plan to shift to India. The enthusiasm shown by NRIs to buy residential property in India, bodes well for the growth of housing in the coming months.</p>

<p>A host of new infrastructure development projects in and around Dwarka Expressway are set to provide a big connectivity boost to this prime expressway of Gurgaon which is all set to become operational next year. This will in turn result in&nbsp; property price appreciation in the area.</p>



<p>The opening of one of these projects- Basai flyover will&nbsp; further enhance the connectivity of Dwarka Expressway , giving real estate&nbsp;along this longest elevated urban road a big boost. Though the formal inauguration will take place later, the flyover has been opened to traffic to observe vehicular movement in actual conditions and real time.</p>



<p>Built at a cost of Rs 110 crore, this half a kilometre long flyover , will reduce congestion in the area, ease commuting, thereby benefiting&nbsp;thousands of residents&nbsp; living in highrise buildings along Dwarka expressway&nbsp; &nbsp;The Basai flyover will improve&nbsp; Dwarka Expressway connectivity with other parts of the city. To further ease vehicular movements towards Dwarka expressway, National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) will be preparing a report to construct an elevated&nbsp; road between Umang Bhardwaj Chowk and Hero Honda Chowk . This will significantly improve Dwarka Expressway connectivity with NH8.The city&#8217;s first full cloverleaf flyover is likely to be completed by December end. This will link SPR, CPR and Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway. SPR meets Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway near Kherki Daula. NPR (Dwarka Expressway) is near Delhi- Gurgaon expressway. With the construction of this cloverleaf, the Gurgaon portion of Dwarka Expressway will get completed , providing a very big benefit to the residents living in the residential societies along the expressway.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Dhanwapur railway underpass of Delhi-Rewari rail line in Sector 104, Dwarka Expressway is getting ready. The underpass will connect Old Gurugram sectors and Palam Vihar with new sectors along Dwarka Expressway.&nbsp; The expressway will also get connectivity push with the proposed construction of service roads. The Gurgaon Metropolitan Development Authority(GMDA) has floated a tender for&nbsp;the construction of service roads along both sides of Dwarka Expressway. These service roads, which&nbsp; will come up along&nbsp; a 15 km long stretch from Central Peripheral Road(CPR) to Delhi border, will ensure better connectivity to sectors along the expressway.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dwarka Expressway is set to benefit from rail infra upgrade in the city. The existing railway station of Gurgaon (10 minutes drive )&nbsp; will get a major revamp under which infrastructure&nbsp; at the railway station will be upgraded to handle more passengers and tracks&nbsp; by constructing fourth railway platform, besides expanding the existing platform and increasing the number of entry and exit points&nbsp; of the station. There is also a plan for the construction of another railway station&nbsp; along the Dwarka Expressway to cater to large population already living in recently developed sectors in New Gurgaon including Dwarka Expressway . The electrification of Delhi-Gurgaon &#8211; Jaipur rail line is already underway while electrification of railway line between Garhi Harsaru and Farrukhnagar is completed .</p>



<p>The Metro connectivity project of Dwarka Expressway to be undertaken by Haryana Mass Rapid Transport Corporation&nbsp; is likely to start soon. Dwarka Expressway will get metro link through the extension of Metro line from Huda city centre to Old Gurgaon via Hero Honda Chowk, Sector 9, 4, 23&nbsp; and Palam Vihar&nbsp; Dwarka Expressway&#8217;s metro link will prove to be a big booster for its connectivity with Gurgaon&#8217;s top residential, commercial , employment and recreation hubs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GMDA is raising its monthly spending on infrastructural development to Rs 100 crore.

<p>The National Highway Authority of India&#8217;s (NHAI)&nbsp; is putting into motion its plan to&nbsp; fast track traffic on Sohna&nbsp; Road to benefit people living on both sides of the newly constructed Sohna elevated road. On anvil is a plan to construct an underpass and a slip road to unclog Sohna Road to ensure smooth and fast traffic on this prime real estate corridor of South of Gurgaon.</p>



<p>As per the plan, an underpass will be constructed at Vatika Chowk to ensure uninterrupted&nbsp; movement of vehicles on Southern Peripheral Road (SPR) which intersects Sohna Road at this crucial junction which has the high concentration of traffic The construction of a slip road will be done at Shishpal Vihar T Point in order to ensure easy entry and exit&nbsp; from Sohna road for commuters going towards Shishpal Vihar. The traffic will also be streamlined under Sohna elevated road by tackling congestion at Tikri Cut, Shishpal Vihar T Point and Vatika Chowk by effecting changes in design and engineering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only recently Sohna&#8217;s connectivity got a boost with Gurugram Metropolitan City Bus Limited(GMCBL) launching a new bus service between Huda City Centre Metro Station and Sohna Bus Terminal. This bus route&nbsp; provided connectivity&nbsp;boost&nbsp; to many areas with high footfall like Ardee City, Mayfield Garden, Park hospital, Vatika Chowk, Damdama etc in South of Gurgaon. Earlier, the operationalisation of 6-lane access-controlled elevated expressway linking Rajiv Chowk, Gurgaon (NH8) with Sohna , had considerably reduced&nbsp;congestion and travel time, providing connectivity impetus to residential and commercial developments along Sohna Road .&nbsp;</p>



<p>The improved connectivity in South of Gurgaon has been providing a boost to the area&nbsp; as an emerging&nbsp; logistics and warehousing hub with well known companies like Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, Uniqlo, H&amp;M as there is a quick access to Delhi, Faridabad, Noida, Ghaziabad&nbsp;and beyond. Warehousing companies are taking advantage of proximity to highways, expressways like NH8, NH248A, KMP Eway, Delhi-Mumbai Expressway. Indospace already has a 51 acre Logistics Park and global logistics firm, ESR has planned to develop a 76-acre logistics park.</p>



<p>Sohna&#8217;s strategic location and excellent connectivity  makes it a superior real estate destination in the NCR, offering end-users and investors a wide choice of properties in the form of apartments, independent floors and villas at different price points. As HSVP is coming up with a 500 acre mega residential and commercial hub, in Sector 35-36 Sohna, this will make this macro market all the more attractive. The upcoming connectivity to  new ISBT and metro station on Vatika Chowk along with the new mobility plan  will further accelerate real estate and infrastructural developments, thereby pushing up the livability index of the area. This inturn will increase the attractiveness of , South of Gurgaon as a hot destination for investors. The easier and faster road connectivity will further beef up real estate investment of the area, leading to property appreciation which has seen double-digit growth.<gwmw style="display:none;"></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the global headwinds ,the positive business environment on the back of the&nbsp;&nbsp;supporting economy holds great promise for the growth of real estate , especially residential real estate that has seen healthy demand due to the rising trend of home ownership.</p>



<p>A recent survey&nbsp; of multinational companies&nbsp; conducted jointly by the Confederation&nbsp;of Indian Industry (CII) and global consultancy firm, Ernst &amp; Young has revealed that more than 60 percent MNCs have appreciated reforms like Goods &amp; Services Tax(GST), digitalisation of various facets of economy, transparency in taxation ,which have helped to create a positive business environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What more, the ongoing reforms have created a positive environment&nbsp; for foreign investments in Indian businesses. The financial year 2021-22 has seen FDI inflows of USD 84.8 billion, despite the adverse impact of Covid pandemic and geo political disturbances. The survey has shown that MNCs find India a potential investment destination and are embarking on their expansion plans. They are bullish that with more reforms like&nbsp; infrastructure upgradation , promoting ease of doing business and tax reforms, the FDI will gain further momentum . Especially as India has a potential to attract FDI flows of USD 475 billion in the next 5 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this backdrop, MNCs are bullish that the Indian economy will perform well over the next 3-5 years due to strong momentum in domestic consumption , services, digital economy and infrastructure . And all this bodes well for the growth of Indian real estate.</p>
